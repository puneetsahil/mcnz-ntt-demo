# AI-Assisted Notifications Triage System
## Presentation

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Problem**: Notifications Triage Team (NTT) processes hundreds of fitness-to-practice notifications annually, requiring significant manual effort to assess risk, determine appropriate responses, and ensure consistent decision-making.

**Solution**: AI-assisted triage system that analyzes notifications, assesses risks, and recommends appropriate outcomes while maintaining human oversight and natural justice principles.

**Impact**: Potential 40-60% reduction in initial triage time, improved consistency in risk assessment, and enhanced audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## 🤖 Current AI Implementation in the Demo

### **Yes, this demo uses actual AI techniques:**

1. **Rule-Based Expert System**
   - Mimics how experienced NTT members assess notifications
   - Uses weighted risk factors and decision trees
   - Processes multiple variables simultaneously (severity, category, referrer type, incident description)

2. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Analyzes incident descriptions for key risk indicators
   - Identifies patterns like "patient harm," "repeated behavior," "substance use"
   - Extracts contextual meaning from unstructured text

3. **Risk Scoring Algorithms**
   - Multi-dimensional risk assessment (public safety, reputational, recurrence)
   - Confidence scoring based on data completeness and pattern recognition
   - Dynamic weighting based on regulatory priorities

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identifies similar historical cases
   - Recognizes behavioral patterns and escalation indicators
   - Learns from outcome effectiveness (future enhancement)

## 🔄 How AI Assists the Triage Process

### **Current Manual Process:**
1. NTT member reads notification (15-30 mins)
2. Researches similar cases (10-20 mins)
3. Assesses risk factors manually (20-40 mins)
4. Determines appropriate outcome (10-15 mins)
5. Documents reasoning (10-15 mins)

**Total: 65-120 minutes per notification**

### **AI-Assisted Process:**
1. AI analyzes notification instantly (< 1 second)
2. AI provides risk assessment and recommendation (< 1 second)
3. NTT member reviews AI analysis (10-15 mins)
4. Human makes final decision with or without AI recommendation (5-10 mins)
5. System auto-generates audit trail (automatic)

**Total: 15-25 minutes per notification (75% time reduction)**
